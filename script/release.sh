# Release command — produces ONLY the product contract artifact.
#
# The repo contains four Soroban contracts, each its own standalone Cargo
# project with its own lockfile (no shared workspace):
#
#   contracts/stream          -> fluxora_stream.wasm           (the product)
#   contracts/archival-probe  -> fluxora_archival_probe.wasm   (throwaway, NOT product)
#   contracts/factory         -> fluxora_factory.wasm          (policy factory)
#   contracts/governance      -> fluxora_governance.wasm       (multi-sig governance)
#
# The archival probe is described in its own manifest as "NOT part of the product"
# and exists only to prove the live-network archival/restore round trip that the
# unit suite structurally cannot (see KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1). It must never be
# deployed to mainnet or shipped as a release artifact.
#
# Because the contracts are isolated projects, there is no shared output
# directory for a probe wasm to accidentally leak into. The build runs inside
# `contracts/stream` and this command verifies that its release output contains
# only the product artifact and nothing else that would be deployable.
#
# This release command builds ONLY the products that ship (currently the stream
# contract) and then asserts that no other contract artifact is present in the
# output. It is the single entry point a release/publish pipeline (or a human)
# uses to obtain deployable artifacts.
#
# Usage:
#   script/release.sh
#
# Output:
#   <repo>/contracts/stream/target/wasm32v1-none/release/fluxora_stream.wasm
#
# The probe, factory, and governance contracts remain independently buildable
# and testable (`cargo build`, `cargo test` inside their own directories; see
# .github/workflows/ci.yml) and are archived out of release pipelines by not
# being built here at all.
