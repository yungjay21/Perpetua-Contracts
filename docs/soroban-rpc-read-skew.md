# Pin your Soroban reads to a single ledger

*A note from the Perpetua team. Written against Stellar testnet, protocol 27,
`stellar-cli` 27.1.0, on 2026-08-12.*

## The pattern

**If you derive one figure from two Soroban RPC view calls, pin both to the same
ledger — or do not derive it from two calls at all.**

A public RPC URL is an endpoint, not a node. Requests behind it may be served by
different backends, and those backends need not be at the same ledger height at
the same instant. Nothing in the JSON-RPC surface tells you which ledger you got
unless you look: every response carries `latestLedger`, and almost no client
code reads it.

Two consequences worth designing against, neither of which produces an error —
you get a plausible wrong answer instead:

1. **Read-after-write.** Read immediately after a confirmed write and you may
   observe pre-write state.
2. **Cross-call derivation.** Combine two reads into one number and the halves
   may describe different moments, making the result arithmetically impossible.

The rest of this note is why we went looking, and what to do instead. The
pattern above stands on its own — it is the correct way to use any
load-balanced read endpoint, and it costs almost nothing to adopt.

## What prompted us to look

Perpetua is a payment-streaming contract. Value accrues continuously, so we have
a conservation invariant:

```
vested(t) + refundable(t) == deposited      exactly, at every instant
```

Our on-chain test suite proves this per-ledger over thousands of random
schedules. So when a script that calls the two views back to back against live
testnet reported

```
vested=22000000  refundable=583000000  deposited=600000000
  ->  22000000 + 583000000 = 605000000   ✗ off by 5000000
```

the natural conclusion was a contract bug — 5,000,000 stroops conjured from
nowhere.

It was not. On that stream the rate was 1,000,000 stroops/second, so the
discrepancy was **exactly five seconds of accrual**: the two view calls
described moments five seconds apart. A `top_up` in the same script separately
appeared to be a no-op — the write was confirmed, but the `get_stream`
immediately afterwards returned the pre-top-up deposit.

Both symptoms are explained by the two calls not sharing a ledger, and both went
away when we added the barrier below. We spent real time hunting a contract bug
that did not exist, which is the cost this note exists to save you.

## The observation, and its limits

We looked directly at `getLatestLedger`, which needs no contract:

```bash
prev=0
for i in $(seq 1 25); do
  s=$(curl -s -X POST https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getLatestLedger"}' \
      | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["sequence"])')
  if [ "$prev" -ne 0 ] && [ "$s" -lt "$prev" ]; then
    echo "went BACKWARDS: $prev -> $s"
  fi
  prev=$s
done
```

One run, around ledger 4,097,07x, showed the endpoint reporting a *lower* height
than it had a moment earlier:

```
went BACKWARDS: 4097075 -> 4097071
went BACKWARDS: 4097075 -> 4097071
went BACKWARDS: 4097076 -> 4097071
went BACKWARDS: 4097076 -> 4097071
went BACKWARDS: 4097076 -> 4097071
went BACKWARDS: 4097076 -> 4097071
backwards transitions in 25 reads: 6
```

Six transitions in twenty-five reads, spread about five ledgers — consistent
with the five seconds of accrual we had just seen unaccounted for.

**We could not reproduce it again.** Everything afterwards was clean:

| run | method | samples | backwards steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `curl`, fresh connection, no delay | 25 | **6** |
| 2 | Python `urllib`, 150 ms interval | 60 | 0 |
| 3 | `curl`, fresh connection, no delay | 60 | 0 |
| 4 | Python `urllib`, 200 ms interval, 8 minutes | 375 | 0 |

That is **one anomalous run against 495 subsequent clean samples**, including run
3, which repeated run 1's method exactly, thirty minutes later.

So we are not claiming this is a general or ongoing property of the endpoint,
and you should not repeat it as one. A single unreproduced observation is
consistent with several explanations — a backend briefly catching up after a
restart, a transient routing artefact, or something local to our client at that
moment — and we cannot distinguish between them from one sample. If you are at
SDF and have data that rules it out, we would genuinely like to know; we will
amend this note.

**What does not depend on that question is the engineering pattern.** Pinning
multi-call derivations to a single ledger is correct whether or not the endpoint
ever skews, because you cannot verify from the client side that it did not, and
because `latestLedger` is right there in every response. It costs one field
check. Treating a single URL as a single node is an assumption you are making
either way — this just makes it explicit and cheap to stop making.

## Frontend SDK guidance: poll until the target ledger

If your app submits a Soroban transaction and immediately reads contract state,
add a barrier. In practice, this means polling `getLatestLedger()` until the
node is at or beyond the target ledger for your write, then reading the stream
state. Treat that read as the boundary between "write not yet visible" and
"safe to display".

The pattern is simple:

1. Submit the transaction.
2. Wait for the transaction to be included in a ledger.
3. Poll `getLatestLedger()` until it reaches or passes the ledger sequence you
   just observed.
4. Read the contract state only after that boundary.
5. If the ledger still lags, retry instead of deriving a number from stale data.

### TypeScript example

```ts
import type { rpc as SorobanRpc } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';

async function waitForLedger(
  rpc: SorobanRpc.Server,
  targetLedger: number,
  { maxAttempts = 40, pollMs = 1000 } = {},
): Promise<number> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    const latest = await rpc.getLatestLedger();
    if (latest.sequence >= targetLedger) {
      return latest.sequence;
    }
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, pollMs));
  }

  throw new Error(
    `RPC did not reach ledger ${targetLedger} after ${maxAttempts} attempts`,
  );
}

async function readStreamAfterWrite(
  rpc: SorobanRpc.Server,
  txHash: string,
  contract: { read: (args?: any[]) => Promise<any> },
) {
  const tx = await rpc.getTransaction(txHash);
  const includedLedger = tx?.resultMeta?.v3?.sorobanTransactionMeta?.sorobanMeta?.ledger
    ?? tx?.resultMeta?.v3?.ledger;

  if (typeof includedLedger !== 'number') {
    throw new Error(`Transaction ${txHash} is not yet included in a ledger`);
  }

  await waitForLedger(rpc, includedLedger, { maxAttempts: 40, pollMs: 1000 });
  return contract.read();
}
```

The precise `tx.resultMeta` field names can vary slightly by SDK version, but the
idea is stable: read the included ledger from the transaction result, then wait
for the node to advance to that sequence before querying state.

### React / frontend pattern

```ts
async function refreshStreamState() {
  const tx = await submitStreamTransaction();
  const latestLedger = await rpc.getLatestLedger();

  // Poll until the node is at least as far as the write's ledger.
  while ((await rpc.getLatestLedger()).sequence < tx.ledgerSequence) {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  }

  return rpc.getContractValue({
    contractId: STREAM_CONTRACT_ID,
    key: 'stream',
    // or whichever view your app uses
  });
}
```

If your UI reads the stream immediately after a top-up, withdrawal or claim,
this barrier is the difference between a stale read and a correct one. The rate
of accrual is not the only thing that can drift between ledgers — the node you
read from can also still be behind the one that included your transaction.

## What to do

These are ordered by preference. The first one makes the problem structurally
impossible and is worth designing your contract's views around.

### 1. Return everything you need from one call

If a client needs vested, withdrawable and refundable together, give it a view
that returns the whole struct and let it compute the three locally. One call is
one ledger, by construction; there is nothing to pin.

Perpetua's `get_stream` does this, which is why the fix for our own script was
partly "stop calling `vested_of` and `refundable_of` separately".

### 2. Put a barrier after every write

Do not read straight after a write. Wait until the backends you can see have
caught up to the ledger containing your transaction. A cheap version: sample
`getLatestLedger` until several consecutive samples are all at or beyond your
target height.

```bash
settle() {
  local target hi=0 ok=0 tries=0 s
  target=$(latest_ledger)
  while [ "$ok" -lt 4 ] && [ "$tries" -lt 40 ]; do
    s=$(latest_ledger)
    [ "$s" -gt "$hi" ] && hi=$s
    if [ "$s" -ge "$target" ] && [ "$s" -gt 0 ]; then ok=$((ok+1)); else ok=0; fi
    tries=$((tries+1)); sleep 1
  done
}
```

Requiring several *consecutive* samples at or above the target is what makes
this work: a single passing sample only tells you that *one* backend has caught
up, and the next request may well go to a different one.

### 3. When you must use several calls, check `latestLedger`

Every Soroban RPC response carries it. Read it from each response in the set,
and if they disagree, discard and retry rather than combining them. If you are
only sanity-checking rather than displaying, a bounded tolerance is enough — our
exercise script allows about 30 seconds of accrual on the conservation check,
with a comment saying why.

### 4. Never assert exact equality across two calls in a test

A test that asserts `a() + b() == c()` across three separate simulations against
a public endpoint will fail intermittently, and every failure will look like a
contract bug. Either derive all three from one call, or assert within a
tolerance you can justify.

### 5. Run your own RPC if you need strict read-after-write

A single node you control cannot skew against itself. For an indexer or a keeper
this is worth the operational cost; the barrier pattern above is a mitigation,
not a guarantee.

## What this is not

**Not a consensus or data-integrity problem.** Any node serving an older ledger
is serving a valid, internally consistent view of a real ledger. Ledger *N* is
not wrong; it is just older than *N+5*.

**Not a criticism of the RPC infrastructure.** Read-your-writes consistency
across load-balanced replicas is a standard distributed-systems tradeoff, not a
defect, and the same caveat applies to essentially every hosted blockchain RPC.

**Not Soroban-specific.** It is worth writing down only because the client
tooling presents one URL as though it were one node, and because in a
*streaming* contract — where the correct answer changes every second — the
symptom impersonates a contract bug closely enough to send you debugging the
wrong thing.

## Summary for client authors

| do | don't |
|---|---|
| derive everything from one call where possible | combine two view calls into one number |
| barrier after writes, requiring several consecutive samples | read immediately after a write |
| check `latestLedger` on each response and discard mismatched sets | assume consecutive reads are monotonic |
| assert within a justified tolerance in tests | assert exact cross-call equality against a public endpoint |
| run your own node if you need strict read-after-write | conclude the endpoint is fine because one loop looked clean |
